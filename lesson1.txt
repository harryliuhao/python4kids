lesson 1:
1a. Print command
print("hello world")

fun exercise: timing the typing of 26 characters without error

b. variables
variables can be given value, even a very large number, then you can reuse the number over and over again in a formula without having to retype the numbers.

For example:
Kai typed
D=9999999999999
U=12325534

and he typed some crazy formulas like D-U-U-U-U, or D*U-U-D

c. different variable types
String type
W='W'
A='SS'
W+A

D=A
and D will get 'SS' instead of A because without quotation, A is a variable and not a String

Try W-A, but it doesn't work

But multiplication will work
try A*5
